Originally I maintained this so I could update this application through Chocolatey, however New Vector got hacked, and they deleted every previous version that was precompiled, even some versions I hadn't pushed yet. This was demoralizing since there were now some versions that could not be added, all previous package versions up to 1.1.1 were broken. And now, they don't have precompiled versions for release candidates like they used to. I didn't use any scripts to assembly a NuGet package, so I always had to do it manually, which is a lot of busy boring work that I didn't always want to do, which is why some updates would take longer than usual. On top of that, this application wrongly auto updates it's self, so with all of this together, it was really hard for me to justify working on this package and pushing updates. It was just a lot of work I didn't want to do ever. Eventually somebody else decided they wanted to work on the package, so I let them, I didn't plan on ever packaging any new changes so better to let someone else do it, than let it never get updates.
